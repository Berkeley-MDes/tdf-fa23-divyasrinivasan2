# Week 4 9/18- Photon 2 Microcontroller #

This week, we were introduced to the new microcontroller project where we'll be using Photon 2. I have heard of Arduino and Raspberry Pi (though never worked with them) but have never heard of the Photon. 
We worked on unboxing and connecting the device to WiFi, which went smoothly. I've been exploring how others have used the Photon 2 to get some ideas and have come across some interesting projects- using it to project the best train route when leaving your house, monitoring plant health, showing a physical emoji pop up when its used on slack, and more. After thinking about what I'd be interested to do for this project, I have a few general buckets:

- Bringing nature indoors through sensors
- Mental health and meditation
- Art installation related to social/environmental awareness
- Disruptive/random that emphasizes connection and communication

Looking forward to what we do this week!
