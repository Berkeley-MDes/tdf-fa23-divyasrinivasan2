# Week 1 8/28- Phone Case in Rhino #

This week we played around with Rhino and Grasshopper which was very challenging and interesting. 

Some things I learnt:
- How to open Rhino with and without Grasshopper and toggle different viewports
- How to adjust parameters in Grasshopper and see how if affects things in Rhino
- See how coding parameters in Grasshopper is done and try (with little success) to understand the coding done by TJ in Grasshopper
- Troubleshooting Rhino+Grasshopper (with help from Cody) - 
  - Figuring out how to "bake", and export the baked results
  - Realizing that my layers were locked, which is why I couldn't access certain layers to delete older baked parts
  - How to group and disable code in Grasshopper

Things I want to figure out:
- How to adjust beyond the sliders in grasshopper and rhino, but actually make adjustments to the design (ex: curved edges with Fillet tool)
- Beginner coding in Grasshopper for a more basic object
- General practice in 3D design with Rhino

Reflection and Speculation:
It's pretty amazing that a tool like Grasshopper exists, and with some parameters and constraints it can automatically generate a design. Even speaking to Cody and other students of architecture and understanding how its used to create full sized buildings blows my mind. While it is a tool that has a high initial learning curve, I hope that over time and with more familiarity to the software, things will get easier, and it'll be more feasible to tweak ot create in this software. 
I'm curious to know how this tool designs "organic-shaped" objects with constraints. Most examples I've seen with grasshopper include some kind of latticing as well as more soft, organic features (which is the opposite of what I think of when I hear parametric design). As someone who has a lot of interest in biomimicry and nature-inspired design, I wonder if there's any way to actually feed constraints that somehow are based on the rules of nature or what we see in the natural world.
