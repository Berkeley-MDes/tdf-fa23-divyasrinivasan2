# Week 11 - 11/6 - Art and Technology #

There were a lot of interesting learnings this week, especially in the area of Art and Tech. Two particular events that presented new ideas to me:
 - Mohit Bhoite: A member of the Particle company, Mohit spoke to us in TDF and showed a lot of beautiful, intricate electronic sculptures he makes. What struck me as especially unique was the open framework of these structures, and showing off the cabling in a delicate way which was cool to see, as well as how they do quite random things and the fact that he makes them in the span of a weekend is very impressive. I hadn't seen anything like it and enjoyed looking at them up close. 
- Talk with Koi Ren: A student from Cohort 1, I really enjoyed her chat with us, and her journey is inspiring to me. She has a corporate job but also makes her own New Media art on the side and displays them in galleries and art residencies. It was great to see how these passions merged and gave me more hope for being able to figure out how to pursue multiple passions in the future. 

In addition, we did some brainstorming for the final project, looking at things like Wearbles, Dancing Oobleck, Reactive Hopscotch, and Dream Recreation:
